Footnotes
=========

The plugin allows to add footnotes in an easy way to a text. There is no need for numbering the footnotes.

The references have a link to go back to the previous reading position.

The plugin uses Footnoted from Jacob Heftmann:

Installation and use with EasyMDE
---------------------------------

* Download the ZIP archive to your PC.
* Unzip the archive.
* Load the directory `/footnotes` in the extracted ZIP archive in the directory `/bl-plugins` on your server.
* Load the file `plugin.php` in the directory `/easymde` in the extracted ZIP archive in the directory `/bl-plugins/tinymce` on your server.
* There will be two new buttons in the toolbar of the editor. The first one is for adding the code for the footnote to the text, the second one for adding the code for the list with the references below the text. Please add references between `<li>` and `</li>` to the list of references.
